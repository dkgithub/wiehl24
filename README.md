Mastering Model Building with PyTorch

PyTorch Tutorials

* If you not familiar with torch, start here: **torch_tensor_tutorial_basics.ipynb**
* Start here: **torch_autograd_tutorial.ipynb**
  * It is meant as an demonstration - part of the code is advanced
* (extra on GPU vs CPU speed try it at home if you have access to a GPU: add_material/torch_tensor_tutorial_timing.ipynb)

The main part is
* Intro: **PyTorch_jet_flavor_classification.ipynb**
* Solutions are in add_material

* Lecture will be added later

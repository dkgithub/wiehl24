        "The curves above are produced by scanning potential values to cut on the network output and examining the resulting signal classification (true positive) and background mis-classification (false positive) rates.\n",

        "Naturally, a well performing network has a high true positive rate while keeping the (reciprocal) false positive rate at a reasonably low (high) level. For the choice of the axes above, this would lead to a curve that is bent towards the upper right corner. But be aware that other representations of the ROC curve exist which might look somewhat different (e.g. \"1 - false positive rate\" on the y-axis). Their message is, however, identical.\n",
        "\n",
        "A commonly used proxy that compiles the values for all possible cuts into one metric is the area-under-curve - **AUC**. A value of 1 signalizes a perfectly working network that allows for a cut value leading to 100% signal efficiency and 0% background contamination. Opposed to that, a value of 0.5 means that the two output distributions of signal and background events are probably fully overlapping, lacking the opportunity to apply a cut that would favor signal examples. A value of 0 has the same logical meaning as 1, but the definition of what is signal and background is flipped. Therefore, the distance from 0.5 is what actually matters here.\n",
        "\n",
        "A value above 0.75 is already quite decent, but there's still potential. You can try to beat this value in the full training setup below."
